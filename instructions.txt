Webpack boilerplate with SASS and Babel

To build the file, use "npm run build"
- The JavaScript file built is named with a hash, that's why it has a long name
- The built files are located on the dist folder

To see realtime changes with a local server, use "npm run dev"
- The server settings can be found and changed in the devServer object at webpack.config.js
- Server process can be stopped with ctrl + c on the terminal

How does the module settings work at webpack.config.js?
- It reads the files extensions trough RegEx and applies a loader to that file
- The RegEx is defined at the test key and the loader is defined at the exclude key
